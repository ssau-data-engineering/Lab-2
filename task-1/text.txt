 Thanks, Mark. You're welcome. Look, there's a free table over there. Yeah, right here you are. Oh! Oh! I'm really sorry. Don't worry. It's always the same. When I wear white, something like this always happens. Look, first I'll get you another coffee, then we can go shopping. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. First I'll get you another coffee, then we can go shopping. Shopping? Yeah, I want to buy you a new shirt. You can't go to a meeting like that. But we don't have time. The next meeting's at 12.30. We have time. It's only 11. Are you sure? Yes. Sit down and relax. Let's have coffee and then go. Well, okay. Thank you.
